# ProfitCalculator
-- My very first project --

You'll have to type out /home at the end of the local server to reach the home page i'm working on trying to make that my default. I've only been using python and Django 
for about week. This is by no means a finished product. I have an issue with allowing floats in the user input boxes making more accurate estimates impossible atm.

This was originally going to be just for truckers but on an uber ride home I spoke with the person about making this and they stated she could use it, So I've 
adjusted accordingly.

-- Fixed Cost Calculator -- 
Takes all of your fixed costs and adds them together then divides by the total miles driven to display your average cost per mile as well as a total cost factor. 

-- Variable Cost Calculator -- 
Takes all your variable costs and adds them together then devides by the total miles driven with a hidden value on average fuel cost which needs to be maintained
manually hopefully with updates I can use a webscraper to nab the average from a site.

-- Profit Calculator -- 
Very basic calculation taking in the price of fuel, your miles driven and your average mpg, reduces how much you are/were paid and then displays the basic math to user.
